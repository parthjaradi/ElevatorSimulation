# ElevatorSimulation
The project is an Elevator Simulation implemented in C++ using multi-threading. It also uses Windows Graphics to depict the simulation of the system on Windows Console
The Simulation takes the input from the user regarding the number of passengers at any given time.
On running the program, Windows Console will open and ask for the "Number of Passengers".
Enter any positive number requesting for the elevator.
The Console screen will show which elevator is selected and show simulation of how the elevators
are moving using Windows Graphics.
When all requests are fulfilled, it will again ask for the "Number of Passengers". If you want to continue
enter another number else enter 0 to exit simulation.
Once 0 is pressed, before exiting the program, Windows Console will show the final state of elevators and the
floors they are at.
The program also generates two text files "simulationStatistics.txt" and "simulationLogData.txt" in the 
project solution folder.
"simulationStatistics.txt" shows the data about each of the elevator.
"simulationLogData.txt" keeps log of all the important events during simulation.
